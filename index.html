          <h3>The Desire to learn</h3>
          <p>
            The desire to start learning programming did not
            come from a young age, as perhaps with some.
            I thought about the fact that I can't be where I am all my life, I
            want something After finishing school, I decided to work, but the
            further I go, the harder it gets more. after searching myself in several sciences, I saw why not the future
            profession, programming, coding, after all, I'm young, I should
            learn a little I found Codeacademy on google and decided to give it
            a try.
